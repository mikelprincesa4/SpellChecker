# SpellChecker
Checks the spelling of text file that is imported. Compares the text with an imported dictionary of properly spelled words using hash tables.
All text files in this repository are text files I used to test my program. Feel free to create your own text file and test the spell checker's accuracy.
An test .txt file can be found inside the "test" folder.
Roman Numerals and numbers are not included in the dictionary and will flag as a mispelled word.
User has the ability to use the bottom pane to scroll through mispelled words and change the spelling on the fly.
Made in collaboration with partner Josh Blohm.
